# mapbox-overview
A brief overview of Mapbox.com services and features.    

[Mapbox.com](https://www.mapbox.com/) is a robust geospatial software as a service (saas) for developers, including products such as toolkits for mobile app development, navigation, web maps, and data management. Their service model is based on a [paid subscription](https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/), but they offer a free service tier for those interested in using their services for learning, with enough resources to get you started. Use of services is authorized on a user-basis by an access token.     

**[How Mapbox Works](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/)** is a great place to start learning about Mapbox.

## main services
**[Mapbox JS Classic](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v3.2.0/)** is the classic JS library based on Leaflet.js. ***This product is no longer being actively developed***, but is still a good resource for learning, especially the [examples](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/).    

**[MapboxGL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/)** is the vector tile framework replacing the classic JS. [Examples](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/examples/) of use are immensly helpful for tinkering to understand how it works.    

Mobile app developers may find the **Navigation SDK** (for [iOS](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/navigation/overview/), and [Android](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/navigation/overview/)), and **Maps SDK** (for [iOS](https://www.mapbox.com/ios-sdk/maps/), [Andriod](https://www.mapbox.com/android-docs/maps/), and [Unity](https://www.mapbox.com/unity-sdk/maps/)) most useful.    

For those interested in customizing data and tiles, **[Mapbox Studio](https://studio.mapbox.com/)** is for you. The [Studio Manual](https://docs.mapbox.com/studio-manual/overview/) is a starting point for learning, and so are the [how-to videos](https://www.mapbox.com/videos/).     

Mapbox also provides **APIs** for programmatic access to their [maps](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/), [navigation](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/navigation/), and [geocoding services](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/#geocoding).    


## some cool stuff
**[Cartogram](https://apps.mapbox.com/cartogram/#7.06/48.758/-123.374)** lets you upload a photo to autogenerate custom tiles.     

They also offer a **[static map builder](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/interactive-tools/static-api-playground)** which creates static map images at your dimension of choice.
